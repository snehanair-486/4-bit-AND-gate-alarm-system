# 4-Bit-AND-Gate-Alarm-System
An AND gate-based alarm system is a simple yet effective digital security solution that ensures an alarm is triggered only when all security conditions are met. This system is ideal for home security, bank lockers, or restricted areas where multiple security layers must be breached before sounding an alarm.

Logic Rule:

● Alarm turns ON (1) only if all sensors detect an intrusion (1 1 1 1).
● If any sensor is OFF (0), the alarm remains OFF (0).
